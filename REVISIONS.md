- I did not have much time to think about how efficient my code was, and if there was room for improvement there (though I don't see anything pop out at me now after a brief look). But I feel like I went down a solid path for this problem and coded a reasonable solution.
  - I did go back and forth between making something an array vs. an object a couple times, so I could have been more thoughtful up front about how to proceed there.
- I did not put in any checks for invalid inputs (non-array inputs, array elements that were strings, etc.). With more time I would have put some checks in to prevent errors.
- I would like to have built more robust tests, especially once I refactored a bit and separated out some of the logic into different functions.
