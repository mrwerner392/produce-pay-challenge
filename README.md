- This repo can be found at https://github.com/mrwerner392/produce-pay-challenge.

- My response to the prompt can be found in `answer-to-challenge.txt`.

- To run, navigate into the root directory in your terminal and run `node index.js`. The answer will be logged as a table in your terminal.
  - (If you do not have NodeJS runtime or do not want to install it, you can also open the index.html file in your browser and check the developer console.)

- To test against other inputs or # of evolutions, simply change the global vars at the top of `index.js`.
